# Mandelbrot
Creates the Mandelbrot set on a Ti calculator.

I recommend you to set -1 to Ymin, 1 to Ymax, -2 to Xmin, and 1 to Xmax for the best view (this is done it the window menu for the calculator). other settings will provide a zoomed in or zoomed out view (can also be fun) an easy way to zoom in is using the zoom box feature on the calculator after it finishes however you will then have to run the program again to re render for the new zoom

The MANSMALL file is the smallest the code can be compacted and still run( it is 18 lines, 15 comands) it still needs to be tested though

also just a note it does the render process for evey pixel in the graphing area so if you have a Ti-84 + C silver expect it to take ~5 hours (give or take 2 hours I wasnâ€™t vary scientific in measuring) for a full picture. 

ps if you wish to biuld from the sorce code use use https://github.com/Lekensteyn/parse8xp to compile it. else just download the .8Xp
