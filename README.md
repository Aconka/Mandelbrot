# Mandelbrot
Creates the Mandelbrot set on a Ti calculator.

I recommend you to set -1 to Ymin, 1 to Ymax, -2 to Xmin, and 1 to Xmax for the best view (this is done it the window menu for the calculator). other settings will provide a zoomed in or zoomed out view (can also be fun) an easy way to zoom in is using the zoom box feature on the calculator after it finishes however you will then have to run the program again to re render for the new zoom

also just a note it does the render process for evey pixel in the graphing area so if you have a Ti-84 + C silver expect it to take ~5 hours (give or take 2 hours I wasnâ€™t vary scientific in measuring) for a full picture.
